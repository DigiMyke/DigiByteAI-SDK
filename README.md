An open-source AI SDK for interacting with the DigiByte blockchain.

## Introduction
DigiByteAI-SDK is a cutting-edge toolkit that combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain** to empower developers with AI-driven automation, security, scalability, and privacy enhancements in DigiByte-based applications.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Troubleshooting Installation Issues**
If you encounter missing dependencies, try:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To verify installation:
```bash
python -c "import requests, bitcoinlib, cryptography; print('All dependencies installed successfully.')"
```

## Getting Started
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the SDK
```python
from digibyte_ai import DigiByteWallet, TransactionHandler, AIAnalytics
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Wallet
```python
wallet = DigiByteWallet()
wallet.create_wallet("my_secure_wallet")
print(wallet.get_address())
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Transaction
```python
try:
    tx = TransactionHandler()
    response = tx.send_transaction("recipient_address", 10)  # Sending 10 DGB
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(str(e))
    print(f"Transaction failed: {str(e)}")
```
