# DigiByteAI-SDK
An open-source AI SDK for interacting with the DigiByte blockchain.

## Introduction
DigiByteAI-SDK is a cutting-edge toolkit that combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain** to empower developers with AI-driven automation, security, scalability, and privacy enhancements in DigiByte-based applications.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install requests bitcoinlib cryptography flask_limiter cachetools
```

### **Troubleshooting Installation Issues**
If you encounter missing dependencies, try:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To verify installation:
```bash
python -c "import requests, bitcoinlib, cryptography; print('All dependencies installed successfully.')"
```

## Getting Started
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the SDK
```python
from digibyte_ai import DigiByteWallet, TransactionHandler, AIAnalytics
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Wallet
```python
wallet = DigiByteWallet()
wallet.create_wallet("my_secure_wallet")
print(wallet.get_address())
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Transaction
```python
try:
    tx = TransactionHandler()
    response = tx.send_transaction("recipient_address", 10)  # Sending 10 DGB
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {str(e)}")
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Transaction Optimization
```python
optimized_fee = AIAnalytics.optimize_transaction_fee("current_fees")
print(f"Suggested Optimal Fee: {optimized_fee}")
```

## AI-Driven Use Cases
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Smart Contracts Evolution**
- AI continuously **analyzes and optimizes** smart contracts based on usage patterns.
```python
def evolve_smart_contract(contract_code, execution_metrics):
    return f"Smart contract optimized based on {execution_metrics}."
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Multi-Agent Negotiation for Blockchain Transactions**
- AI bots negotiate terms **autonomously** for optimal transactions.
```python
def ai_negotiate_transaction(buyer, seller, price_range):
    return f"Negotiated deal: {buyer} and {seller} settled at {price_range[1]}"
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Quantum-Resistant Ledger Security**
- AI implements **future-proof cryptography** to withstand quantum threats.
```python
def integrate_quantum_ledger(transaction_data):
    return "Quantum Ledger integration successful."
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Based Predictive Governance for DAOs**
- AI **analyzes governance proposals** and predicts voting outcomes.
```python
def ai_governance_simulation(proposal, historical_data):
    return f"AI predicts {proposal} will have {historical_data['success_rate']} success."
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Web3 Identity Verification**
- AI-enhanced **decentralized KYC** for trustless identity verification.
```python
def ai_biometric_verification(user_data):
    return "User identity successfully verified using AI biometrics."
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Enhanced NFT Market Liquidity Engine**
- AI **adjusts NFT pricing models dynamically** for better market efficiency.
```python
def ai_nft_liquidity_optimization(nft_id, market_conditions):
    return f"NFT {nft_id} liquidity optimized based on {market_conditions}."
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Smart Lending & Risk Management in DeFi**
- AI **assesses risk exposure** for lending platforms and liquidity pools.
```python
def assess_defi_risk(protocol, audit_status, liquidity):
    risk_score = (1 - audit_status) * (100 / liquidity)
    return f"DeFi Risk Score for {protocol}: {risk_score:.2f}/10"
```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Auto-Healing Blockchain Systems**
- AI **detects and repairs blockchain inconsistencies** autonomously.
```python
def auto_heal_blockchain(blockchain_state):
    return "Blockchain inconsistencies automatically repaired."
```

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Based Fraud Detection for Exchanges & Wallets**
- AI **analyzes transaction patterns** to detect fraudulent activities.
```python
def detect_fraudulent_activity(transaction_logs):
    return "No fraudulent transactions detected."
```

### **üîü AI-Powered Real-Time Cybersecurity Threat Prediction**
- AI monitors blockchain networks **for potential cyber attacks** before they occur.
```python
def ai_predict_cyber_threats(network_logs):
    return "Threat assessment complete. No immediate risks detected."
```

## Deployment Enhancements
### **Auto-Scaling for API Servers**
```bash
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name DigiByteAIGroup \
  --launch-template LaunchTemplateId=lt-123456789 \
  --min-size 1 --max-size 10 --desired-capacity 2
```

## Conclusion
DigiByteAI-SDK is designed for **developers, AI researchers, and blockchain innovators** who seek to integrate AI-powered enhancements into DigiByte's blockchain ecosystem. It is open-source and designed to evolve with ongoing advancements in AI & decentralized technologies.
