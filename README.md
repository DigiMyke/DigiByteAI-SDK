# DigiByteAI-SDK
An open-source AI SDK for interacting with the DigiByte blockchain.

## Introduction
DigiByteAI-SDK is a cutting-edge toolkit that combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain** to empower developers with AI-driven automation, security, scalability, and privacy enhancements in DigiByte-based applications.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Troubleshooting Installation Issues**
If you encounter missing dependencies, try:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To verify installation:
```bash
python -c "import requests, bitcoinlib, cryptography; print('All dependencies installed successfully.')"
```

## Getting Started
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the SDK
```python
from digibyte_ai import DigiByteWallet, TransactionHandler, AIAnalytics
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Wallet
```python
wallet = DigiByteWallet()
wallet.create_wallet("my_secure_wallet")
print(wallet.get_address())
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Transaction
```python
try:
    tx = TransactionHandler()
    response = tx.send_transaction("recipient_address", 10)  # Sending 10 DGB
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(str(e))
    print(f"Transaction failed: {str(e)}")
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Transaction Optimization
```python
optimized_fee = AIAnalytics.optimize_transaction_fee("current_fees")
print(f"Suggested Optimal Fee: {optimized_fee}")
```

## AI-Driven Enhancements
### **DigiByte's Capabilities & AI Enhancements**
DigiByte provides **fast transactions, strong security, and scalability**. However, some AI-powered enhancements require **additional integrations** or **external layers (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, Oracles, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, or cross-chain bridges)**. The table below outlines which AI features work natively and which require external infrastructure:

| AI Feature | Supported by DigiByte | Requires External Integration |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| AI-Optimized Transactions | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditing | ‚úÖ (via DigiAssets) | ‚ùå |
| AI-Driven Blockchain Security Monitoring | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| AI-Powered Fraud Detection | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| AI-Enhanced Digi-ID Authentication | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| AI-Driven DAO Governance | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (via DAOs like Aragon) |
| AI-Powered Liquidity Management | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (via wDGB on DeFi platforms) |
| AI-Based Smart Contract Execution | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (via Layer 2 like Rootstock) |
| AI-Optimized Privacy Transactions (ZKPs) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (via zk-Rollups) |
| Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contracts | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (future research) |

### **Key AI Enhancements Supported by DigiByte**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Adaptive Transaction Fee Adjustment**
```python
def ai_adaptive_fee_adjustment(network_fees, tx_priority):
    return f"Transaction fee optimized to {network_fees['optimal_fee']} DGB based on priority: {tx_priority}."
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Based Real-Time Smart Contract Threat Intelligence**
```python
def ai_smart_contract_threat_detection(contract_activity):
    return "Threat detected! AI suggests remediation." if contract_activity["risk_score"] > 75 else "Smart contract secure."
```

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Blockchain Network Latency Reduction**
```python
def ai_network_latency_optimization(node_data):
    return f"Network latency reduced by {node_data['latency_reduction']}% using AI-driven routing."
```

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Autonomous Blockchain Patch Deployment**
```python
def ai_autonomous_patch_deployment(vulnerability_report):
    return f"Security patch applied: {vulnerability_report['patch_id']} to mitigate {vulnerability_report['issue_type']}."
```

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Auto-Adaptive AI Training on Blockchain Data**
```python
def ai_auto_training_on_blockchain(blockchain_data):
    return f"AI model updated with {len(blockchain_data)} new blockchain activity records."
```

### **Future AI-Driven Enhancements (Require External Integrations)**
- **AI-Powered ZK-Rollups for Scalability**
- **AI-Enhanced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Privacy Transactions**
- **AI-Based Quantum-Resistant Encryption for Future Security**
- **AI-Driven Multi-Chain Interoperability Using Cross-Chain Bridges**
- **AI-Powered DAO Sentiment Analysis for Governance Decisions**
- **AI-Driven Automated Fork Detection & Adaptation**
- **AI-Powered Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contracts**

## Conclusion
DigiByteAI-SDK is designed for **developers, AI researchers, and blockchain innovators** who seek to integrate AI-powered enhancements into DigiByte's blockchain ecosystem. While DigiByte provides **fast, secure, and scalable transactions**, some AI-driven functionalities require **Layer 2 solutions, Oracles, DeFi integrations, or interoperability with external blockchains**.
